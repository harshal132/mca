#Wild Cards in Generics Theory
The question mark (?) is known as the wildcard in generic programming . It represents an unknown type. The wildcard can be used in a variety of situations such as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable; sometimes as a return type. Unlike arrays, different instantiations of a generic type are not compatible with each other, not even explicitly. This incompatibility may be softened by the wildcard if ? is used as an actual type parameter.

#Types of wildcards in Java:
1. Upper Bounded Wildcards: 
These wildcards can be used when you want to relax the restrictions on a variable. For example, say you want to write a method that works on List < integer >, List < double >, and List < number > , you can do this  using an upper bounded wildcard.
To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound.
example:
public static void add(List<? extends Number> list)

2. Lower Bounded Wildcards: 
It is expressed using the wildcard character (‘?’), followed by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.
Syntax: Collectiontype <? super A>

3. Unbounded Wildcard: 
This wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?), for example, List. This is called a list of unknown type. These are useful in the following cases
When writing a method which can be employed using functionality provided in Object class.
When the code is using methods in the generic class that don’t depend on the type parameter
